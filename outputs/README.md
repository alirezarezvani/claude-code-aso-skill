## Workflow Integration

### Quick Commands

**Full ASO Audit:**
```bash
/aso-full-audit MyApp
```
Output: Complete folder structure in `outputs/MyApp/`

**Metadata Only:**
```bash
/aso-optimize MyApp
```
Output: `outputs/MyApp/02-metadata/` folder

**Pre-Launch Check:**
```bash
/aso-prelaunch MyApp
```
Output: `outputs/MyApp/04-launch/` folder

**Competitor Analysis:**
```bash
/aso-competitor MyApp "Todoist,Any.do,Microsoft To Do"
```
Output: `outputs/MyApp/01-research/competitor-gaps.md`

---

## Updating Outputs

If you run the same command again, the system will:
1. **Backup existing outputs** to `outputs/MyApp.backup.[timestamp]/`
2. **Generate fresh outputs** with updated data
3. **Preserve completed tasks** from action checklists

This ensures you never lose work, but always have latest data.

---

## Success Metrics

After implementing outputs, track these metrics:

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Keyword rankings improved for 3+ priority keywords
- [ ] Conversion rate baseline established

**Month 1:**
- [ ] 20%+ increase in impressions
- [ ] 10%+ increase in conversion rate

**Month 3:**
- [ ] ASO health score increased by 15+ points
- [ ] Top 10 ranking for 5+ priority keywords

**Month 6:**
- [ ] 50%+ increase in organic installs
- [ ] 4.5+ average rating with 100+ reviews

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Character limits exceeded

**Solution:** Check metadata files - they should already be validated. If you modified content, use the character counters:
```bash
echo "Your title" | wc -c
# Should be ≤ 30 for Apple, ≤ 50 for Google
```

### Issue: Keywords not ranking

**Solution:** Check `keyword-list.md` for difficulty scores. Start with low-difficulty keywords (< 30) first. High-difficulty keywords (> 60) require months of optimization.

### Issue: Low conversion rate

**Solution:** Review `visual-assets-spec.md` and ensure screenshots clearly communicate value. A/B test different messaging per `ab-test-setup.md`.

### Issue: App Store rejection

**Solution:** Check `submission-guide.md` for common rejection reasons. Most rejections are metadata clarity issues or missing functionality.
